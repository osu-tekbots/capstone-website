        If your project requires an NDA and/or IP agreement, it must be indicated at the time the students select the 
        projects.

        If your company intends to provide proprietary materials or confidential information requiring an NDA, OSU can 
        arrange for a written agreement to reviewed and signed amongst the students, your company, and OSU.

        Such an agreement will authorize the students to use and discuss the provided materials or information with 
        each other and their instructor in confidence.

        The university will not participate in any agreement that requires students to transfer intellectual property 
        rights ownership to your company or puts overly burdensome confidentiality obligations on the students.

        Though OSU certainly appreciates your companyâ€™s sponsorship, we strongly discourage any agreements that could 
        deter students from sharing the results of their academic work at OSU with fellow students, parents or future 
        employers.

        This does not prevent a separate arrangement between you each student individually.';
