				<hr>
				Organized by the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University,
				the Senior Design Capstone program is a year-long course where students are presented with various
				opportunities to design, implement, and promote unique and engaging projects sponsored by companies,
				businesses, and proposers/student clubs with personal projects.
				<br><br>
				This application enables proposers to submit their projects for students to view. Students can apply
				to projects to convey interest and connect with proposers as well.
